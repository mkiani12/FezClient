      Climate change involves long-term shifts in temperature and weather
      patterns, mainly due to human activities like burning fossil fuels and
      deforestation. These actions increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,
      causing global warming. The consequences include rising sea levels,
      extreme weather events, and disrupted ecosystems. Combating climate change
      requires global cooperation to reduce emissions, transition to renewable
      energy, and implement sustainable practices to mitigate its effects and
      adapt to the changing environment.
